# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a work day scheduler. We were given a starter code in HTML for an example on how a box should look when the hour has passed, current, or in the future. We were then suppose to add in JavaScript code where it will save what is written in the text area of each hour, then recall it even when refreshed. Also based on the current time, the boxes will change color.
